# Roulette Calculator
Roulette Calculator for Players or Dealers

Calculator allows you to enter in chips on table for a single player in any position(straight up, split, corner, etc.) besides 1:1's and 2:1's.
Gives back amount won and you can see amount won including the original bet.

Example: Player has 5 chips straight up on a number and 2 chips on a split. Calculator takes input for straightup: 5 and split: 2 and returns 216 as a win and 223 as the win including the original bet. (su*35) + (sp*17)      (su*35+su) + (sp*17+sp).

This was my first ever project in JavaScript and was inspired by the fact that I was once a table games dealer. I witnessed a lot of players and a lot of dealers couldn't do large bet calculations on the spot. In order to look "professional" dealers were expected to be able to do large calculations such as (35 * 7) + (17 * 9) on a fairly regular basis without aid from a calculator. While I was capable of doing these calculations it would have made my life and my colleagues lives much easier to just type in the amounts and payout the winnings.
